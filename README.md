This is just a play language I'm working on to learn how compilers work.  I'm also using this project to better learn Rust.

Current resources I'm following along with to create this compiler are:

* [Super Tiny Compiler](https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler/blob/master/the-super-tiny-compiler.js)
* [LLVM.org OCaml Tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/OCamlLangImpl1.html)
* [Rust Users Forum](http://users.rust-lang.org)
